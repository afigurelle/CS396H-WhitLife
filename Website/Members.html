			I own a fish. I am sophomore Computer Science major at Whitworth University. I am looking forward to this project because I enjoy a challenge and I believe that this
			application can provide a variety of benefits to students new and old at Whitworth. I am a proud resident of McMillan Hall and enjoy playing frisbee when the weather complies.

			I love dogs. I am a second year Physics major with a Comp. Sci. minor at Whitworth University. This project was inspired by the learning curve that I experienced in my first
			year at Whitworth. I live on campus in McMillan and love milk and cookies.
